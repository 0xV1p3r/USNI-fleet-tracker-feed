# USNI-fleet-tracker-feed 

A web scraper getting its data from the [USNI Fleet Tracker](https://news.usni.org/category/fleet-tracker) and sending a notification once a new entry has been detected. A [Pushover](https://pushover.net) integration is currently the only method of notification implemented. Planning to additionally implement a Signal bot integration, the option to send emails with a provided SMTP server, an RSS feed and a telegram bot.
