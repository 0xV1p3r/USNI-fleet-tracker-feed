# USNI-fleet-tracker-feed 

A web scraper getting its data from the [USNI Fleet Tracker](https://news.usni.org/category/fleet-tracker) and sending a notification once a new entry has been detected. A Telegram bot is currently the only method of notification implemented. Planning to additionally implement the [CallMeBot Signal API](https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-signal-send-messages/), the option to send emails with a provided SMTP server and an RSS feed.
