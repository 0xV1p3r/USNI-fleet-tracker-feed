 - i've got a list of image links now, but they are not sorted by date
 - sometimes USNI does not create a new entry but updates the recent one, need to reflect that
 - the images in the entries in the fleet-tracker category are not always the position images
   |-> need to start pulling the image from the direct article instead of the entry

Feature ideas:
 - add email backup: meaning you take the file that contains all data & attach to email, that is regularly send to smb
 - add a version history and last_updated property to TrackerEntry
 - add a progress tracker, for processed entries into logs
