 - i've got a list of image links now, but they are not sorted by date
 - sometimes USNI does not create a new entry but updates the recent one, need to reflect that
 - make an TrackerEntry object that gives structure to the data & pulls & compiles more data


TrackerEntry:
 - id: UUID for storage solution (dunno what yet)
 - image_file_name
 - title
 - image_link
 - date_stringt: 
 - article_link: needs to be pulled as a tag from the image object

Feature ideas:
 - add email backup: meaning you take the file that contains all data & attach to email, that is regularly send to smb
 - add a version history and last_updated property to TrackerEntry
