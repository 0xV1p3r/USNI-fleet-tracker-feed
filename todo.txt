 - add logging (optional logfile)

Handlers (triggered if new entries are found):
 [X] Telegram Bot
 [ ] Email Server
 [ ] Signal bot (self-hosted)
 [ ] Signal bot (callmebot API)

Feature ideas:
 - add email backup: meaning you take the file that contains all data & attach to email, that is regularly send to smb
 - add a version history and last_updated property to TrackerEntry
 - add a progress tracker, for processed entries into logs
