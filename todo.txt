 - Add Email integration

Handlers (triggered if new entries are found):
 [ ] Telegram Bot (usin separate container exposing interal API)
 [ ] Email Server
 [ ] Signal bot (self-hosted)
 [X] Pushover API
 [ ] RSS feed (using rss-feed-genrator container)

Feature ideas:
 - add email backup: meaning you take the file that contains all data & attach to email, that is regularly send to smb
 - add a version history and last_updated property to TrackerEntry
 - make a real entry database that also saves the pictures and not only their URLs
 - develop a telegram bot container following best-practices
 - add the possibility to request the history of search for specific entries via the telegram bot
